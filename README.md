# CrofAI Provider for GitHub Copilot

**Powerful models. Crazy cheap pricing.** — directly inside GitHub Copilot Chat.

CrofAI gives you access to the best open-weight models at the cheapest prices on the market. This extension wires them into VS Code's native model picker so you can use them anywhere GitHub Copilot Chat works — chat, agent mode, inline edits, and more.

## Quick Start

**1. Get your API key**

Sign up at [crof.ai](https://crof.ai/dashboard) and copy your API key from the dashboard.

Free models are available with no credit card required.

**2. Set your API key in VS Code**

Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run:

```
CrofAI: Manage CrofAI Provider
```

Paste your API key and press Enter. The key is stored securely using VS Code's built-in secret storage — never in plain text.

**3. Pick a model in Copilot Chat**

Open Copilot Chat (`Cmd+Shift+I` / `Ctrl+Shift+I`), click the model picker, and select any **CrofAI** model from the list.

**4. Start chatting**

That's it. Ask questions, get code completions, use agent mode — everything works through GitHub Copilot Chat's standard interface.
